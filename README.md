# [Fira Code], but with old style figures baked in

Want to use [Xcode with the Fira Code typeface] but also have a strange dedication to [olde timey numerals]?

As [explained] in the official Fira Code repository, some apps don't respect stylistic alternatives in typefaces, so we can force them into a copy of the font using [OpenType Feature Freezer].
